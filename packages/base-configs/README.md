# `@ivuorinen/base-configs`

This is a meta package for all my base configs.

You can find all the individual configs in the `packages` folder.

The main reason for this package is to make it easier to use these
configs in other projects, and to update them all at once.
No more pull requests to update all the configs one at a time!

## Installation

```bash
npm install @ivuorinen/base-configs --save-dev

yarn add @ivuorinen/base-configs --dev
```
